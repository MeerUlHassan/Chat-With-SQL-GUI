# Chat-With-SQL-GUI

I created this GUI interface with #Streamlit library. Using the interface you can connect any of your database and start chatting.

NOTE : The DB shouldn't be to big or with complex schema. Cuz the LLM cant handle that much tocken and you will get a RANGELIMIT error.

JUST PUT IN YOUR API_KEY AND START CHATTING.
